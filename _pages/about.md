Welcome to my blog. The goal of this website is to share my recent research and share news on my academic life.

About me
======
Holding a PhD in applied mathematics with a focus on actuarial science, I conduct research on risk modeling and risk management, with particular emphasis on climate risk, risk pooling, and parametric insurance. My work relies on tools from probability theory, statistics, optimization, and numerical methods, at the interface of actuarial science, risk economics, and data science.

I am currently the coordinator of actuarial science and finance courses at ENSAE Paris, where I oversee the academic management of a portfolio of courses, coordinate external lecturers, and supervise projects, internships, and master’s theses. I also have extensive experience teaching mathematics, statistics, and actuarial science.
